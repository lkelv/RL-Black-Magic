              The RL Black Magic Program is a trusted upgrade for the CAS calculator that helps students in Methods and 
              Specialist Maths. Designed by expert tutors and used by high-achieving students, it cuts down time spent on 
              repetitive tasks so your child can focus on solving problems, not fighting the calculator.
